// rescue — the "last chance" shared by the rescue sysmodule (sysmodule/) and
// the app: the request file a parent puts on the SD card, and the report the
// sysmodule leaves for PlayGuard.
//
// A parent who forgot the PIN, while the play timer keeps every program from
// starting (PlayGuard included), puts a file named RESCUE (or RESCUE.txt) in
// sd:/config/playguard/ from a computer and turns the console on:
//   - empty, or any text: the sysmodule unlocks parental controls temporarily
//     with the stored PIN (as the PIN screen would), so PlayGuard can open;
//   - a line that reads "delete" (any case, spaces around it ignored): the
//     sysmodule deletes every parental control.
// The request is removed before anything is done (it is used once); should
// that fail it is renamed RESCUE.done, and should that fail too a delete is
// not done (it would run again every boot) while an unlock still is. The
// result is left in rescue_report.txt for PlayGuard, which shows it, records
// it in the change history and removes the report.
//
// Anyone who can edit the SD card can do this, as they can turn off
// PlayGuard's own PIN prompt (pin_lock.hpp): it keeps a child out, not
// someone with a computer. No PIN is ever written to either file. The report
// is a plain file anyone can write, so PlayGuard trusts it only when the
// console confirms it (rescue_report_confirmed) and, for an unlock, when it
// carries the sysmodule's proof (RescueProof): an answer to a challenge the
// app left on the card (RESCUE_NONCE_NAME), keyed with the stored PIN.
//
// Plain C, no libnx: host-tested (tests/rescue).
