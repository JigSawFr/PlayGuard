// PlayTimerSettings (fw 21.0.0+): u16[34] (0x44 bytes), read with 145601 and
// written with 195101. Observed on a console with a real limit configured
// through the companion app (fw 22.1.0):
//   [0]   = 0x0101    observed header (non-zero <=> IsPlayTimerEnabled)
//   [1]   = 0x0001    ?
//   [2..6]= 0         reserved
//   7 per-day groups, group n at [7+4n .. 7+4n+3], Sun..Sat:
//     [+0] = 0x0600   ? (constant in the observed config)
//     [+1] = 0x0100   "this day has a configured limit" flag
//     [+2] = minutes  that day's limit
//     [+3] = 0        reserved (absent for the last group: the array stops at 34)
// A group left all-zero means "no limit that day".
//
// Read as bytes, the same block is four mode bytes, the companion app's
// "daily" rule and seven per-day rules, 8 bytes each (4 + 8 + 7 * 8 = 0x44).
// The layout of the 22.5.0 pctl sysmodule, as reversed by NX-Pctl-Manager
// (docs/parental-controls.md, "The settings block"):
//   byte 0  enabled (pctl clears it on a write and sets it again itself)
//   byte 1  restrictionMode: 0 ALARM (time's up: a warning only),
//           1 FORCED_TERMINATION (the software is suspended)
//   byte 2  timerMode: 0 DAILY (the daily rule, every day),
//           1 EACH_DAY_OF_THE_WEEK (the per-day rules)
//   byte 3  reserved
//   rule at byte 4 (daily) and 12 + 8n (day n, Sun..Sat), the companion
//   app's regulation (its "timeToPlayInOneDay" and "bedtime"):
//     +0 bedtime on   +1 alarm hour   +2 alarm minute
//     +3 allowed-again hour (the 0x06 of [+0])   +4 allowed-again minute
//     +5 limit flag (the 0x01 of [+1])           +6..7 limit minutes ([+2])
// so the "reserved" [6] and each [+3] hold the next day's bedtime switch and
// alarm hour. The bedtime fields come from that match (pt_bedtime_*), not
// from a console with a bedtime set: the write checks what the console then
// reports (1954/1956/1957) and puts the block back when it differs.
//
// Every block observed is EACH_DAY_OF_THE_WEEK (01 01 01 00), or all zero

// EACH_DAY_OF_THE_WEEK first, the daily rule copied into the seven days
// (all-zero days when it has nothing on), so the console keeps doing the
// same but for the change. The restrictionMode is kept as read.
