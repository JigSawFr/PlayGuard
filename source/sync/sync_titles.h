// sync_titles — what a title the play log names is: a game, a homebrew (an
// NRO forwarder on the HOME menu, PlayGuard's own among them) or one of the
// console's own programs. Only games go to the broker by their ID: a
// homebrew's time is told as one total, and "now playing" as a homebrew
// with no ID (docs/sync-protocol.md). Shared by PlayGuard and the agent
// sysmodule, which cannot read a title's control data: PlayGuard writes what
// it knows in nand/<system>/sync/titles.txt, the agent reads it.
//
// From the ID alone (what holds when nothing else is known): Nintendo's
// applications are 0x0100000000010000 and above with 0x01 as their top byte,
// its own programs below 0x0100000000010000; the forwarders sphaira and
// PlayGuard make take 0x05 as their top byte (core/forwarder_pack.h), and any
// ID outside 0x01 is no Nintendo application. A homebrew installed under an
// ID of the 0x01 range is a game by its ID: only the record can say.
