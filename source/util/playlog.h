// playlog — play time per game for today and the last 7 days, folded from the
// console's play-event log (pdm:qry QueryPlayEvent). Plain C with no libnx, so
// the host tests can feed it made-up logs; source/core/playstats.c reads the
// real one.
//
// How the log is read: a game is played from the moment it gets the focus
// until it loses it (out of focus, exit), or until something else takes over
// without that being logged for the game (the HOME menu gets the focus after a
// crash, the console sleeps or shuts down, another game starts or gets the
// focus). Durations come from the steady clock, so changing the console clock
// (Console › Network clock) does not stretch them; the user clock only places them
// on the calendar.
